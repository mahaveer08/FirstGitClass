DevOps is a set of practices and tools that aims to improve collaboration and communication between development and operations teams in order to accelerate the software delivery process. The goal of DevOps is to enable organizations to quickly and reliably deliver software updates and new features to customers by automating and streamlining the software development and deployment process.

DevOps is based on several key principles:

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD): This practice involves integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared codebase multiple times a day, and then automatically building, testing, and deploying new versions of the software.

Infrastructure as code: This approach involves using code to define and manage the infrastructure that supports the software, rather than manually configuring servers and other infrastructure components.

Automation: DevOps relies heavily on automation to streamline and accelerate the software development and deployment process. Automation is used to automate repetitive tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying software, as well as to manage and scale infrastructure.

Monitoring and observability: DevOps teams use monitoring and observability tools to gain visibility into the performance and behavior of their applications and infrastructure, in order to quickly identify and resolve issues.

Collaboration and communication: DevOps promotes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams, with the goal of breaking down silos and enabling teams to work together more effectively to deliver software quickly and reliably.

DevOps practices and tools can be implemented using different frameworks, such as:

Agile Methodologies
Scrum
Kanban
Lean
DevOps is not a single tool or technology but a set of practices and culture that helps organizations to improve their software development process, increase the speed of delivery, and improve the overall quality of software products.
